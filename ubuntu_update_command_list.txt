run these commands one by one : 

sudo apt update        # Fetches the list of available updates

sudo apt upgrade       # Installs some updates; does not remove packages

sudo apt full-upgrade  # Installs updates; may also remove some packages, if needed

sudo apt autoremove    # Removes any old packages that are no longer needed

sudo apt install build-essential dkms # need to only do this once per os install 

sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall

sudo reboot
